# Bacteria-silk
Tensile properties of spider MA silk after interaction with bacteria.
Tensile properties of spider MA silk after interaction with bacteria and broth or broth alone, also receiving washing treatment. 
•	Spp - spider species (NP - Nephila plipes)
•	Spider - individual number
•	Layer - washing of surface layers treatment (N - native silk, L - lipids washed out, G - glycoproteins washed out)
•	Treatment - receiving bacterial treatment (T) or no (C)
•	Bacteria - bacteria species (L3 - Microbacterium, PL4 - Novosphingobium)
•	Broth – PBS, CFN (full nutrient w/o carbon), NFG (full nutrient w/o nitrogen)
•	Tensile parameters - thread diameter (um), Young's Modulus (GPa), toughness (GPa), maximum strain (mm/mm) and stress at the break (GPa)
